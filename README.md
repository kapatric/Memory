### Steps
For the Snake game, we'll need to:

Create a grid with cells - the game grid where the snake and food will be.
Move the snake from cell to cell.
Control the snake's direction.
Randomly place food items.
Detect when the snake's head touches the food.
Detect when the snake hits the wall of the game grid.
Detect when the snake hits itself.
Keep track of the score - how many food items are eaten.
